# 🧠 Legal AI Pipeline – GST Notice Response Generator

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered legal drafting system that automates the generation of structured replies to GST tax notices.  

Instead of manually drafting rebuttals, the system:

1. Reads a GST Show Cause Notice (SCN) from a `.docx` file  
2. Extracts individual legal charges  
3. Classifies the nature of each charge  
4. Uses Google Gemini API to generate structured legal rebuttals  
5. Compiles a professionally formatted legal memo in `.docx` format  

The system is modular, scalable, and designed with production-level AI orchestration principles.
